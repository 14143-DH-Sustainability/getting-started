On February 6, 2023, two devastating earthquakes struck southeastern Turkey and northern Syria, resulting in the loss of over 50,000 lives in Turkey alone. The media coverage, social media activity, and official statistics captured only fragments of this massive human tragedy. In the chaos of disaster relief, reconstruction plans, and shifting news cycles, the names and stories of many victims quickly disappeared from public memory. This project proposes a decentralized, community-maintained digital archive to preserve the memory of those lost — hosted entirely on GitHub.

The archive would consist of individual Markdown (.md) files, each one dedicated to a single person who died or disappeared in the earthquake. Each file could contain a short biography, memories written by loved ones, photos (hosted or linked), and relevant metadata: date, city, age, cause of death (if known), and family context. Contributors — whether family members, friends, survivors, or volunteers — could submit entries or fork existing ones to add more detail, translations, or corrections. GitHub’s built-in version control system would ensure that every change is traceable and preserved over time.

Organized into location-based folders (e.g. /Hatay/, /Kahramanmaraş/, /Adıyaman/), this archive would function like a digital cemetery — not as a static monument, but as a living, growing space of collective remembrance. Importantly, contributors could remain anonymous, and a moderation system would be put in place to protect sensitive information and avoid politicization.

The goal is not only to document the dead, but to challenge the way we process mass trauma. In official contexts, individuals often become statistics. This project seeks to re-individualize grief — to honor the lives behind the numbers and make mourning a visible, participatory act. Hosting the archive on GitHub ensures transparency, openness, and long-term accessibility. It also invites collaboration across disciplines: coders, designers, writers, and activists can all contribute.

Beyond remembrance, the archive has the potential to become a resource for researchers, journalists, and civil society actors interested in disaster accountability, urban injustice, and social memory. It can serve as a template for similar future crises, especially in regions where state records are incomplete or inaccessible.

In short, this project is about resistance to forgetting — through community, through memory, and through code.
