    <h1>Tracing Ottoman-German Relations through Archival Documents</h1>
    <p>
        This project aims to systematically analyze documents in the Ottoman archives that reference Germany, especially focusing on the 19th and early 20th centuries. During this period, the relations between the two forces underwent significant developments in political, economic, and cultural spheres.

    <p> 
        The project will examine a range of archival materials, including treaties, diplomatic correspondence, military cooperation documents, trade agreements, and cultural exchange reports. These documents will be analyzed to explore Germany’s position in the Ottoman perspective, the stages of bilateral relations, and their social impacts. The project will particularly focus on critical periods such as the reign of Sultan Abdulhamid II and the years leading up to and during World War I.

        The goal is to understand how the complex relationship between the Ottoman Empire and Germany is reflected in archival materials. The findings will contribute to our understanding of Ottoman modernization, foreign policy, and Europe’s role in shaping the empire's external relations. Ultimately, the project will create a database of the documents, which will be made available for future research and further study.
