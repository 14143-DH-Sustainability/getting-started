    <h1>Sounds of Arabic Dialects</h1>
    <p>The idea behind the project is to cover different Arabic dialects, primarily on how they sound.</p>
    <p>The resource base can be connected to the youtube or to the social media channels, in order to receive the latest content on the targeted dialect. The problem is that often the courses concentrate on one dialect with exluding others, however it would be helpful to know how they might sound. Also it can work as useful tool to learn a dialect or to know where to search for the information.</p>
    <p>The academic research is still mainly use written sources in developing language acquisition. However building up at least basic understanding on how dialects sound in different countries can help to develop skills in differentiating and concentrating on one of them.</p>
