  <h1>Modern Turkey's Protest Culture Archive </h1>
  <p>
    This digital project aims to document and archive key protest movements in Turkey from the 1960s to the present, focusing on significant events such as the Gezi Park protests, the 1968 Youth Movement, and the May 1st, 1977 massacre. The goal is to create an accessible, visual resource that captures the essence and impact of these movements on Turkish society and politics.

  <p>
    Each event will be accompanied by a brief description, one or two images, and potentially further resources over time. The focus is on providing a clear and concise overview of each protest's historical context, key figures, and social or political outcomes. As the project progresses, it may include additional resources like video clips, interviews, and archival documents to enhance the depth of understanding.
  </p>
  <p>
    Technically, the project can begin with a simple interface, offering a clean, user-friendly web site. In the future, a database could be integrated to allow for dynamic content updates, search functionality, and more interactive features. This archive will not only serve as a historical resource but also provide insights into the evolution of protest culture in modern Turkey and its ongoing relevance in shaping public discourse and activism.
