The project will create a digital dictionary that focuses solely on Arabic words with non-Arabic origins. Each entry will include:
The Arabic word (in Arabic script)
Transliteration and pronunciation
Original language of origin
Meaning in both Arabic and English
Historical context of when and how it entered Arabic
Example usage in modern context
The dictionary will be searchable by Arabic script, transliteration, or origin language. 
It will also be designed to work seamlessly in Arabic-first environments, 
flipping the script on the Latin-default interfaces of most language apps.
