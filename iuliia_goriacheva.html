    <h1>Arabic Dialectology: Transcriptions and Recordings</h1>
    <p>
        This project aims to collect and organize Arabic dialect transcriptions and recordings from various regions. 
        The focus will be on gathering data from accessible sources and collaborating other researchers.
    </p>
    <p>
        An interactive map will be created to visualize the geographic distribution of different dialects, highlighting areas 
        with existing research and under-researched regions. The map will display the geographic distribution of various Arabic dialects across the Arab world.</p>
        By clicking on specific regions of the map, users will be able to access transcriptions and audio recordings with features and peculiarities of the respective dialect. This will provide an insightful look at the diversity of the Arabic language.</p>
    </p>
    <p>
        The project will involve collecting available transcriptions and audio samples from open-access sources and digitizing 
        fieldwork data.
    </p>
    <p>
        This open-access platform will support collaboration and learning, helping students and researchers to engage with 
        Arabic dialects and expand the scope of dialectology studies, with the potential to grow over time.
