        <p>
            The idea is to examine Palestinian press in a time frame from 1920 to ca. 1960. I will examine how ideological shifts and currents are reflected in rhetorics. This could include independent newspapers as well as magazines affiliated with political parties, organizations, etc. Through the comparison of some of those magazines I could highlight different approaches to same events. It can include diaspora newspapers as well.

            While I&#8217;m still unsure on how comprehensive the project should be, I hope to acquire technical skills that could make such an endeavor easier and well arranged.
