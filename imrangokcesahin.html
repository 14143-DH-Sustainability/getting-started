    <h1>A Connected Tool for Hieroglyphic Sign Identification</h1>
    <p>TThe aim of this project is to create a database in order to make a discourse analysis around the current student movements under the AKP regime and the regime's attack on academic freedom. The given data will first be about the Boğaziçi Resistance of 2021 and how the pro-government media represented the students and the movement around academic freedom. Secondly, another part of the data will be about the current student movement and resistance that took place after 19 March. The data will include social media posts, newspaper articles, political speeches by MPs and government officials. The archive will have a timeline and a chronological map where the user can move between dates and related media. The interface must be able to display videos, photos and voice recordings. To show the parallels or differences between two movements, there can be two chronological lines where the user can click at any time. The data must be categorised to show what kind of discourse the AKP regime is trying to construct around youth, university, student movements and education.</p>
