    <h1>Comparative Analysis of Nazi Trials in East and West Germany </h1>
    <p>This project investigates the judicial handling of Nazi war crimes by categorizing significant trials in East (GDR) and West Germany (FRG) according to their chronological occurrence. Utilizing contemporary newspaper articles and official trial records.</p>
    <p>The project aims to provide detailed documentation and analysis of how these trials were perceived and reported by the media in each respective state. The central objective is to highlight similarities and divergences in judicial practice and societal responses between the two German states during the Cold War.</p>

    <p>The comparison will focus specifically on key elements of the trials, including the backgrounds and perspectives of judges, jury composition, profiles of the defendants, and the nature of the verdicts handed down. By examining these dimensions, the project will elucidate the differing legal philosophies, political motivations, and ideological pressures at play in East and West Germany.</p>

    <p>This approach not only provides historical clarity but also contributes to a nuanced understanding of how post-war justice was shaped by geopolitical factors. It intends to demonstrate how East Germanyâ€™s trials were often ideologically influenced by Soviet priorities, while West German trials were impacted by Western judicial norms and external pressures, particularly from the United States. This comparative framework offers critical insights into the legacy of justice and memory in divided Germany.</p>
