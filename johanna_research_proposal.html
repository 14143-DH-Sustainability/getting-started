    <h1>Accessible Map Tool for Inclusive Urban Navigation</h1>
    <p>I want to develop a digital tool that uses a map displaying barrier-free public spaces — including roads, sidewalks, cafés, and other locations.</p>
    <p>In cities like Berlin, not every street or walkway is accessible to wheelchair users or people with physical disabilities. </p>
    <p>The goal of this tool is to make it easier to navigate public spaces without encountering unexpected obstacles, promoting greater independence and inclusion. I envision the tool to be a helpful aide in planning of a journey across the city.</p>
    <p>The idea is that anyone can contribute in marking public spaces as accessible. Accessibility status can be updated at any time to reflect unforseen construction work or other temporary obstacles.</p>
