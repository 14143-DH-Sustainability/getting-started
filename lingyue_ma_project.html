            <h1>A Tool for Mapping Ancient Mathematical Expressions</h1>
            <p>This project aims to build a dynamic digital platform to explore how numbers and mathematical operations were symbolically expressed in ancient Indian and Chinese traditions.</p>
            <p>Drawing on sources such as Sanskrit word-numerals (bhuṭasaṃkhyā), Chinese calendrical cycles, divination systems, and rod numerals, the project builds a multilayered database linking contexts, numbers, cultural symbols, and mathematical actions. It seeks to reveal hidden patterns in word selection and arrangement, and to develop a model for reimagining the processes through which mathematical knowledge was constructed, evolved, and transmitted.</p>
            <p>Beyond exploration, the project supports new forms of research into cultural patterns of knowledge transmission, and allows users to generate poetic renditions of mathematical ideas and proofs, following historical literary forms like Sanskrit meters and Chinese regulated verse. By integrating symbolic reasoning and creative cultural practices, it offers an embodied way to experience mathematical thinking, reviving mathematics as a living part of cultural imagination.</p>
