  <h1>Mapping the Poetic World of Mahmoud Darwish</h1>
  
  <p>
    This digital humanities project explores the poetry of Mahmoud Darwish by combining literary interpretation with digital methods. It aims to create a curated digital corpus of his poems in Arabic and to analyze recurring words and themes using basic text analysis tools.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Word frequency analysis will be used to identify dominant terms, and the results will be presented in an engaging visual format, such as a bar chart, bubble chart, or sunburst diagram. These charts will help reveal recurring motifs and thematic patterns across the corpus.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    A further goal is to extract and visualize place names mentioned in the poems. These geographical references—such as cities, regions, and landmarks—will be displayed using an interactive map, offering a spatial view of Darwish’s poetic world. This visualization will help highlight how places are remembered, imagined, or longed for throughout his work.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    The project will be implemented in Python using libraries such as NLTK, Plotly, and Geopy, and it will be documented and published on GitHub. By applying digital tools to Arabic texts, this project contributes to small-scale but meaningful digital humanities research and opens up new ways of engaging with modern Arabic poetry.
