    <h1>HSKme: A Digital Tool for HSK Vocabulary Learning</h1>
    <p>HSKme is a Digital Humanities project designed to assist students preparing for the HSK (汉语水平考试 Hànyǔ Shuǐpíng Kǎoshì), the official Chinese language proficiency exam. The project focuses on building a learning platform based on corpus frequency data to support vocabulary acquisition effectively.</p>
    <p>I began by creating structured JSON files containing vocabulary lists for different HSK levels. A simple website was developed to display these lists dynamically in a single field, allowing users to interact with the words and select correct answers. A basic registration form was added to collect user information; it is currently a prototype and does not yet implement security measures such as hashing or salting.</p>
    <p>The project is published through GitHub Pages and is accessible via the domain <a href="http://hskme.com">hskme.com</a>. The source code is available on <a href="https://github.com/Quchluk/HSK">GitHub</a>. At this stage, the content is primarily in Russian, catering to my current student base, but an English version is planned for release.</p>
    <p>Although the platform is still in its early stages, the long-term goal is to create an open, scalable, and flexible tool for HSK vocabulary learning, with future enhancements such as personalized exercises and browser-based educational games under an MIT license.</p>
