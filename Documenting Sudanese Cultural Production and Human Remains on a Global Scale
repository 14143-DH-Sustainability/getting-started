    <h1>Documenting Sudanese Cultural Production and Human Remains on a Global Scale</h1>
    <p>Over the last decade, numerous researchers have started digitising ancient Sudanese artefacts in Sudan. While Sudanese cultural heritage remaining in Sudan has been well-documented, there is a lack of understanding of how much of Sudanese cultural production and human remains are located outside of Sudan.</p>
    <p>My idea is to create a database where I will collect all evidence and information available on Sudanese archaeological goods in diaspora.</p>
    <p>There will also be the option for people to upload their findings to the database.</p>
