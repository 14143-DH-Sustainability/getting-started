    <!--THE GONGO EFFECT ON CIVIL SOCIETY
The project explores how Turkish government uses government-organized non-governmental organization’s (GONGO’s) to shape and control civil society.  While civil society often seen as a key part of democracy, this project asks whether government involvement in civil society actually weakens democratic participation. By looking at a timeline of when key GONGOs and independent CSOs were founded and how they have changed over time, basic profiles of each organization (goals, leadership, funding, and activities), visual maps showing links between the government and these organizations, short case studies showing how GONGOs affect the visibility, funding, and influence of independent CSOs this project will help users understand how GONGOs operate and what their impact is on the space for independent civil action in Turkey. It will also raise questions about the true meaning of civil society under increasing government control.
