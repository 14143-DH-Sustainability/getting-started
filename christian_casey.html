    <h1>A Connected Tool for Hieroglyphic Sign Identification</h1>
    <p>This project addresses a longstanding need in Egyptological research: a clear, accessible link between Egyptian hieroglyphic signs and their real-world counterparts. Building on the existing Thot Sign List, the project develops a comprehensive digital sign list that connects hieroglyphs with relevant data such as museum objects, scholarly debates on sign identification, scientific studies of Egyptian flora and fauna, polychrome inscriptions, and ancient art showing these elements outside of textual contexts.</p>
    <p>Drawing on years of collected research and my experience in building digital tools for ancient language study, I will create a freely accessible online database that brings together all available information on the identification of hieroglyphic signs. The tool is designed for both specialists and interested non-specialists, with a commitment to open access and long-term sustainability.</p>
    <p>The database is structured to grow over time, remaining open to updates as new discoveries are made. Beyond supporting research into orthography and script development, it offers a platform for exploring the material grounding of the hieroglyphic system. Conversations with colleagues and recent scholarship confirm a strong demand for such a resource, which aims to reshape how we understand the intersection of language, image, and the physical world in ancient Egypt.</p>
