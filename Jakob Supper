The project aims to examine the Palestinian press from approximately 1920 to 1960, focusing on how ideological shifts and political currents are reflected in rhetorical choices and editorial framing. This includes the study of independent newspapers as well as publications affiliated with political parties, cultural organizations, and nationalist movements. By comparing the rhetoric of different periodicals—both within Palestine and in the diaspora—it will be possible to highlight contrasting approaches to key events and issues such as British colonial policy, Zionist immigration, and internal Palestinian political debates. Diaspora newspapers offer a unique lens, reflecting the transnational dimensions of Palestinian identity and political thought.

To enhance the organization and replicability of the project, GitHub can serve as a central platform for collaboration and version control. Digitized articles, annotations, and metadata can be organized into a structured repository. GitHub Pages can be used to create a project website or digital archive. Jupyter notebooks or Python scripts for content analysis, text mining, or natural language processing can be stored and documented, allowing for transparency and reproducibility. Over time, this technical infrastructure could support comparative analysis, visualizations, and even public engagement. The project also provides an opportunity to develop technical skills in digital humanities, including data curation, OCR correction, and text analysis.
