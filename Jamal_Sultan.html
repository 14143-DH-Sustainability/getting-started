    <h1>My Midterm Project Idea</h1>
    <p>
        For my midterm project, I plan to create a simple and informative website that highlights major cities in Palestine. The site will showcase important cities like Jerusalem, Gaza, Ramallah, Nablus, and Hebron. For each city, I will include a short description, key historical facts, and cultural highlights that make each place unique.

        The goal of the project is to educate visitors about Palestineâ€™s rich history, culture, and resilience through its urban centers. I want the design to be clean, user-friendly, and visually engaging, using basic HTML and CSS. If possible, I may also include a small image gallery or interactive elements like clickable city maps.

        This project will help me improve my web development skills and give me the opportunity to present an important and meaningful topic. It also challenges me to structure information clearly and design a layout that is easy for users to navigate. I hope this website will not only be a technical exercise but also a small contribution to raising awareness about Palestinian heritage.
