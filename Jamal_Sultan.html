    <h1>My Midterm Project Idea</h1>
    <p>
        For my midterm project, I would like to build a simple personal website that introduces who I am, my interests, and some of the projects I have worked on. The website will have a homepage, an about-me section, and a gallery of things I like â€” such as books, sports, photos, or music. I want to use HTML and CSS to create a clean and minimal layout, and maybe add a little JavaScript for some interactivity, like a light/dark mode toggle.

        My main goal is to learn how to structure a website from scratch and use GitHub properly to manage my code. This will help me become more confident in front-end development. I also want the site to be mobile-friendly and fast. If I have time, I might experiment with animations or transitions.

        In the final version, I hope to have a nice-looking portfolio that I could even share with friends or future employers. This project will give me a chance to practice everything we are learning in this course and turn it into something real and personal.
